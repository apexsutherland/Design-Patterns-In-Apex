# Design Patterns In The Apex Programming Language 

Few things have helped me more in my career than understanding how you use the Object Oriented Features of Apex to write code that is flexible,
testable and maintainable. I have done quite a few YouTube videos on this topic and have a lot more more to. I was not happy with 
my previous Repo and its organization. This is an attempt of my part to give back to the community with repo that offers 
implementations of all the class Gang of Four patterns in Apex. I grant you that my implementations will often be trivial 
and contrived. But I hope that helps make the underlying ideas easy to understand. 

## Creational Patterns
Design patterns that are concerned with the creation of objects 

#### The Simple Factory Pattern
- One of my every day go to patterns. Code is based on Head First Design Patterns
### The Reflective Factory
This can be a bit more involved but is also the ultimate in closed for modification but open for extension. 
By making our factory reflective we never need to update it when we add new concrete types.
- Unique to Apex and Salesforce. Refactor the simple factory pattern with custom metadata


## Read All About It
Nothing in this repo would be possible with out the books below. And most of my my implementations will be based on ones 
found in these books. If they are not on your shelf they should be.
